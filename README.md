# Machine Learning Model - Training and Evaluation (CRISP-DM)
<p align="justify">
This is a redoing of a machine learning model training project, following the 6 step CRISP-DM method, previously done for academic purposes.
The business purpose of the model is to analyse user provided URL's and be able to provide a direct assessment, indentifying if they should be seen as potentially malicious (phishing, credential stealer...).

The model will be trained using a tabular dataset available in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/phishing-dataset-for-machine-learning.

Guidance notes and context are provided directly on the jupyter noteboook files, along with the code. 

Current status: 

1. Business Understanding - Done
2. Data Understanding - Done
3. Data Preparation - Ongoing
4. Modelling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment
